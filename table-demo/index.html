        <!--
            the border="1" will add a default border around the table and each cell
        -->
        <table border="1">
            <thead>
                <!-- the thead will indicate a line for colum headers
                    the cell tag for this line will be <th>
                    the contents of the cell will be bolded by default
                
                    optionally one can have their header titles on their rows
                    here the developer uses the first colum (generally) as the 
                    titles for the data
                    if you are designing your table in this fashion then a 
                    thead area is not needed AND the first cell on your tbody
                    row will be a <th> cell

                    the tbody contains the data for the table, each row

                system
                    the text will not have any stylying by default

                    see above for using a <th> cell if you wish for your 
                        headings to appear on the row instead of the colum
                    by defualt you are expected to have one <td> cell for 
                        each <th> cell
                    <td> cells are grouped under a <tr> set of tags
