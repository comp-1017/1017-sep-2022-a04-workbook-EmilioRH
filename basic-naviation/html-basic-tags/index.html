        <h2>Anchor Tag (aka linking to another page)</h2>
        <!--
            This is an anchor tag and is incorrectly often referred to as the link tag
            One should not use the link tag because there is actually a "link tag"
                used in the head section
            The Anchor Tag can take you to a different location whether it be on a 
                different website, different page in the current website or a 
                different location on the current page

            Parameters:
            href: points to the desired location
            target: indicates the browser page display option
                    default is same displaye page tab 
                    _blank will open a new browser tab (page)

            ="filename.ext"

            lower folder
